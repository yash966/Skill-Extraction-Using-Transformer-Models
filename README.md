# Skill-Extraction-Using-Transformer-Models
The extraction of skills involves the identification of abilities stated in documents like resumes and job postings. To avoid omitting skills from a candidate's professional profile, automating the mining process of their skills from their resume is crucial. This study focuses on categorizing high-level skills in the IT domain by classifying resumes. We present a new approach to skill categorization and compare the results to previous studies. Our approach utilizes various transformer-based models, including BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and SimpleRNN, to deduce high-level skills from resumes, even if they are not explicitly mentioned. Our approach is shown to be effective, with an 82% recall rate and an F1 score of 87%, based on experiments conducted on a collection of anonymous IT resumes.
